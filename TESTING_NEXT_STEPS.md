# Testing Infrastructure - Next Steps and Outstanding Tasks

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Testing Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configured Bun's built-in test runner
   - Set up test directory structure (`test/unit`, `test/integration`, `test/utils`, `test/mocks`)
   - Created test helper utilities (`test/utils/test-helpers.js`)
   - Configured coverage reporting in `bunfig.toml`
   - Added test scripts to `package.json`:
     - `test`: Run all tests
     - `test:unit`: Run unit tests only
     - `test:integration`: Run integration tests only
     - `test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
     - `test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage report
     - `test:ci`: Run tests for CI pipeline with coverage and bail on failure

2. **Mock Infrastructure**
   - Created comprehensive Mineflayer mock (`test/mocks/mineflayer-mock.js`)
   - Created test setup file with global utilities (`test/utils/test-setup.js`)

3. **ConfigManager Unit Tests**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for ConfigManager (`test/unit/ConfigManager.test.js`)
   - 36 out of 37 tests passing (97% success rate)
   - Coverage: ~34% of ConfigManager code covered
   - Known Issue: One test failing due to singleton pattern side effects

## 🔄 In Progress Tasks

### Unit Tests for Bot Server Module
- **File**: `test/unit/bot-server.test.js` (not yet created)
- **Requirements**:
  - Test MinecraftBotServer class initialization
  - Test API route handlers
  - Test bot connection/disconnection
  - Test event management
  - Test screenshot generation
  - Mock Express app and Mineflayer bot interactions

## 📋 Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Core Module Testing

#### Bot Server Unit Tests (`src/bot-server.js`)
```javascript
// Key areas to test:
- Constructor and initialization
- Route setup (GET /status, /events, /screenshot, etc.)
- POST endpoints (connect, disconnect, move, chat, dig, place, etc.)
- Event handling and logging
- Error handling and edge cases
- Bot state management
```

#### CLI Tests (`src/cli.js`)
```javascript
// Key areas to test:
- Command parsing and validation
- API client interactions (mocked)
- Output formatting
- Error handling
- All CLI commands (status, connect, disconnect, move, chat, etc.)
```

#### Main Entry Point Tests (`src/mineflayer.js`)
```javascript
// Key areas to test:
- Server start/stop in different modes
- Daemon process management
- CLI command routing
- Configuration loading
- Process signal handling
```

#### Server Module Tests (`src/server.js`)
```javascript
// Key areas to test:
- Server initialization
- Port binding
- Graceful shutdown
- Error handling
```

### 2. Integration Testing

#### API Integration Tests
```javascript
// test/integration/api.test.js
- Full API endpoint testing with real Express server
- Request/response validation
- Authentication (if applicable)
- Rate limiting (if applicable)
- Error responses
```

#### Bot Integration Tests
```javascript
// test/integration/bot.test.js
- Bot connection to test server
- Command execution flow
- Event stream testing
- Multi-command sequences
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing

```javascript
// test/e2e/workflow.test.js
- Complete workflows from CLI to bot action
- Server start → Bot connect → Execute commands → Verify results
- Batch job processing
- Error recovery scenarios
```

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Setup Bun
      - Install dependencies
      - Run tests with coverage
      - Upload coverage reports
      - Build executable
      - Test executable
```

### 5. Coverage Improvements

**Current Coverage Issues:**
- ConfigManager: 34% line coverage
- Need to increase to meet threshold (80% lines, 80% functions)

**Areas needing more coverage:**
- Environment variable overrides
- Profile management edge cases
- Config file error handling
- Schema validation edge cases

### 6. Test Documentation

Create `TESTING.md` with:
- How to run tests
- Test structure overview
- Writing new tests guidelines
- Mocking strategies
- Coverage requirements

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Failing Test
```bash
# Issue: ConfigManager singleton causing test interference
# Solution: Implement proper test isolation
# Location: test/unit/ConfigManager.test.js line 287-302
```

### Priority 2: Complete Unit Tests
1. **Bot Server Tests** (Most critical - core functionality)
2. **CLI Tests** (User interaction layer)
3. **Server Tests** (Basic but important)
4. **Main Entry Tests** (Integration point)

### Priority 3: Integration Tests
1. Set up test server fixture
2. Create API integration tests
3. Test real bot connections (with mock Minecraft server)

### Priority 4: CI Pipeline
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow
2. Add coverage badges to README
3. Set up automated releases

### Priority 5: Performance Testing
- Load testing for API endpoints
- Memory leak detection
- Connection stress testing

## 🔧 Technical Debt to Address

1. **ConfigManager Singleton Issue**
   - Current singleton pattern causes test isolation problems
   - Consider factory pattern or dependency injection
   - Alternative: Reset singleton state between tests

2. **Mock Improvements Needed**
   - Prismarine-viewer mock
   - Canvas mock for screenshot testing
   - Express middleware mocks

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Create fixture files for test data
   - Implement test database seeding
   - Add snapshot testing for complex outputs

## 📊 Coverage Goals

### Minimum Requirements
- Line Coverage: 80%
- Function Coverage: 80%
- Branch Coverage: 75%
- Statement Coverage: 80%

### Current Status
- ConfigManager: ~34% (needs improvement)
- Other modules: 0% (not yet tested)

### Priority Files for Coverage
1. `src/bot-server.js` - Core functionality
2. `src/config/ConfigManager.js` - Configuration management
3. `src/cli.js` - User interface
4. `src/mineflayer.js` - Main entry point

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Recommendations

### Testing Tools to Consider
- **@happy-dom/global-registrator** - For DOM testing if needed
- **bun-bagel** - HTTP mocking library for Bun
- **Snapshot testing** - For complex object comparisons

### Monitoring and Reporting
- **Codecov** or **Coveralls** - Coverage reporting service
- **SonarQube** - Code quality analysis
- **GitHub Actions badges** - Visual indicators in README

## 📝 Notes

### Known Issues
1. ConfigManager test failing due to singleton side effects
2. Coverage reporters limited in Bun (no JSON reporter)
3. Test isolation needs improvement

### Best Practices to Implement
1. Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for proper test isolation
2. Mock external dependencies consistently
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Group related tests in describe blocks
5. Test both success and failure paths
6. Use data-driven tests for multiple scenarios

### Testing Philosophy
- Write tests that catch real bugs
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests simple and maintainable
- Aim for fast test execution
- Ensure tests are deterministic

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The testing infrastructure will be considered complete when:
1. ✅ All core modules have unit tests
2. ✅ Integration tests cover main user workflows
3. ✅ Coverage meets minimum thresholds (80%)
4. ✅ CI pipeline runs on every commit
5. ✅ Tests run in under 30 seconds
6. ✅ Documentation is complete and clear
7. ✅ All tests pass consistently

## 📅 Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete all unit tests
- **Week 2**: Integration and E2E tests
- **Week 3**: CI/CD setup and coverage improvements
- **Week 4**: Documentation and optimization
